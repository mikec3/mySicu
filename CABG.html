        <h3> Procedure: </h3>
        <p> CABG/valve </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p> CAD, valvular disease
  </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p> CABG: Sternotomy, placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, and saphenous vein is used to bypass occluded vessels. Chest tubes and pacer wires are put in place.
Valve: Sternotomy, placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, diseased valve is either repaired or replaced with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve, and chest tubes/pacer wires are put in place.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> Bleeding: Observe chest tube output frequently; if >200ml/hr, Immediately alert surgeon. Have extra blood admin and product tubing at bedside. Have bear hugger on patient: cold blood doesn’t clot.
            <br>
			Cardiac Tamponade: Narrowing pulse pressures and decreased CO/CI, decreased UOP. Triad: muffled heart sounds, hypotension, and JVD. Give fluids and inotropes until intervention.
            <br> 
			Decreased CO/CI: Analyze PA numbers/BP, pacer, intrinsic rhythm, CVP, UOP, chest tube output, fluids/albumin/blood, pressors, inotropes, etc… Make a determination to increase CO/CI.
            <br>
			Pulmonary HTN: Flolan (protect from light)
            <br>
				Systolic Anterior Motion of the mitral valve (SAM) after MVR: Avoid inotropes, aggressive diuresis, and tachycardia. Give Beta blockers, and maintain MAP 80-90.
            <br>
				Hyperglycemia: Insulin drip algorithm for 48hrs per protocol
            <br>
RHF: echo is main diagnostic tool. Inotropes and reduced SVR. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators
            <br>
MI- troponins usually slightly elevated after heart surgery. Requires TEE and possibly IABP until intervention.
            <br>
Afib: Amiodarone load during operation, then 24hr drip (1mg/min for 6hrs followed by 0.5mg/min for 18hrs). Rate control, cardioversion and anticoagulation. 
            <br>
Sternal wound infection and dehiscence: sternal precautions, mupirocin, and chlorehex baths.
            <br>
Thoracic Aortic surgery (AAA only): lumbar drain to augment CSF pressures, also keep MAP >80, these are to prevent paralysis from spinal hypoperfusion.
 <br> 
</p>
        
        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p> Comes out of the OR sedated on propofol. Insulin drip for 48hrs. Amiodarone load during operation, then 24hr drip (1mg/min for 6hrs followed by 0.5mg/min for 18hrs). Inotropes and vasoactive possibly for 24-36hrs. IV AbX post-op. 4mg magnesium immediately post-op. Other electrolytes per BMP (Mg >2, K>4, Po4>4, Ion Ca >2.2). MIVF/driver typically 100ml/hr. Keep all pressors and inotropes on central line through OR manifold. 3 albumin 250ml vials if needed (standing order). Heparin SQ. Mechanical valves require life-long anticoagulation. </p>
        <h4> Principles:</h4>
        <p> Maintain MAP 60-90 (too high can cause bleeding). Strict sternal precautions. Have 2 RNs at bedside for first couple hours. “Fast-track” is to extubate within 2-4hrs of arrival to SICU. </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p> PA cath care (if applicable). A-line care. Sternal Precautions. Aggressive pulm hygiene (IS, OOB, C&DB). Frequent skin care, turning. VAP prevention after initial 24hrs. Pacer assessment/care. Daily CXR/weights/labs/EKG. </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p> "Fast-track": extubate within 2-4hrs, wean propofol, wean pressers as tolerated. Perform 6hrs post-op CBC and BMP. POD#1 OOB to chair, consider home Rx and lasix. Evaluate need for A-line, CVC, PA cath, and chest tubes. Daily EKG, weight, labs, and CXR. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p>Extra blood tubing, albumin bottle and tubing primed, blood product tubing and filters. SCD, bear hugger and full body blanket, 4 suction set-up: yankaur/oral, NG/OG, 2X chest tubes w/ extensions.  IV fluid manifold and 4 primed pumps/tubing. A-line set-up. Possible CVP or PA cath set-up. Vent set-up (RT). O2 supplies for post-extubation.

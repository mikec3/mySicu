        <h3> Procedure:  </h3>
    <a href="mySicuPdf/AAAthoracic.pdf">AAA (Thoracic) </a>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p> Thoracic AAA, usually greater than 5.5 cm in diameter, or rapid aneurysm expansion </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p> Open Surgical Repair – Median sternotomy for ascending and arch aneurysm repairs, left thoracotomy for descending aneurysms, and left thoracotomy incisions for thoracoabdominal aneurysms. An open surgical repair of thoracic aneurysms resembles standard abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with proximal and distal vacular control, minimal aneurysm manipulation, and prosthetic graft repair. End-organ revascularization is achieved with distal anastomosis, native arterial reimplantation with or without endarterectomy, or bypass grafting with saphenous venous or prosthetic control. 
Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta (TEVAR) – minimally invasive approach that involves placing a stent-graft in thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> Complications: bleeding (monitor CT if applicable, if >200/hr alert provider), renal failure, respiratory failure,  stroke, peripheral vascular injury,paraplegia/paraparesis, endoleaks from TEVAR  requiring life-long CT scans, avulsion of the arteries, infection, paralysis from spinal hyoperfusion - lumbar drain for CSF pressures with MAP >80
 <br> 
</p>
        
        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p> Pain managed with NSAIDS and opiates, antiemetic’s for n/v, restart home meds as PO tolerated,  </p>
      <br>
        <h4> Principles:</h4>
        <p> maintain vs per protocol, limit IVF intake to prevent fluid overload, sternal precautions if they apply, lay flat for TEVAR for 6 hours post-op, no bending more than 45 degrees for 24 hours or as ordered, distal pulses checks, MAP’s >80 </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p>  aline care, sternal precautions as they apply, pulmonary toileting, skin care/turning, CXR, weight, labs, Assess for bleeding/infection, ICU monitoring, manage pain </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p>  POD#1  ambulate, d/c foley, restart home meds, advance diet as tolerated, </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p>  Humidified O2, yankaur, oral suction, standard IV pump setup, possible PCA setup, possible epidural setup, aline setup, bairhugger, 3 suction setup, possible ventilator set-up, blood tubing </p>

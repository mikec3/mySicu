        <h3> Procedure: </h3>
    <a href="mySicuPdf/hernia.pdf"> Paraesophageal hernia repair (nissen fundoplication, gastropexy). </a>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p>  Hiatal hernia with GERD that is unrelieved by medical management. A paraesophageal hernia is a true herniated sack of gastric fundus within the thoracic cavity. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p> Performed either laparoscopically or via open abdomen. The hernia is dissected and the hiatal defect is closed. A nissen fundoplication is then most often performed (wrapping of stomach around esophagus to retain competency of the lower esophageal sphincter (to reduce GERD)). A gastropexy is also most often performed (fixation of the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall (to prevent reoccurrence of herniation)). </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> Herniation: Barium esophogram can detect, also CXR.
        <br>
Bleeding: Dissection of gastric blood vessels can cause excessive bleeding, usually controlled intra-op.
<br>
N/V: retching from emesis can disrupt closures, needs barium esophagogram asap.
<br>
Gastric/esophageal perforation: Sepsis if undetected.
<br>
Pneumothorax: Caused by a tear in the pleura during mediastinal dissection.
<br>
Gas-bloat syndrome: inability to vent air from stomach and delayed gastric emptying causes discomfort.
<br>
Dysphagia: Most patients experience this to some degree during first 2-6weeks due to inflammation and edema slowing bolus transit of solid foods.
 <br> 
</p>
        <br>
        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p> Antiemetics: scheduled for first 24hrs, emesis can result in disruption of the hernia repair.
Pain control: Most likely PCA, if open procedure then most likely will have epidural. </p>
        <h4> Principles:</h4>
        <p> Temporary ileus is an expected physiologic response from bowel manipulation. Normal bowel function may take 5 days to return. </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p> Aggressive pulmonary toileting, skin care, wound care, foley care, pain control. Possible PCA, epidural,
And G-tube care. Manage IVF. NPO until barium swallow study on POD 1. </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p> Most likely extubated in OR. POD #1OOB, if ambulating, D/C foley. Barium swallow study, if no leak, advance diet from NPO to CL, then to soft solids, then low residue diet for several weeks. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p>  Humidified 02, oral suction, standard IV-pump, possible PCA, possible epidural, SCDs, and possible suction for NG/OG tube.</p>

        <h3> Procedure: </h3>
    <a href="mySicuPdf/ERCP.pdf"> ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) </a>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p> Bile duct blockage, Bile duct stone removal, CA tissue sampling, Stent placement. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p> Pt is intubated and under GA. Endoscope is passed down esophagus and used to inject dye and inspect pancreatic/gall ducts in conjunction with X-rays. Endoscope is then used to perform desired interventions such as stent, stone removal, or biopsy.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> Pancreatitis & Bacteremia: prophylactic antibiotics.
        <br>
            Bleeding: first priority is repeat endoscopic intervention, then angiographic embolization, then surgery.
            <br>
                        Proximal esophageal perforations: usually can be managed with antibiotics, NPO status, and cervical drainage as needed. Duodenal perforations secondary to the endoscope may result in a large rent of the lateral wall and may require more aggressive therapy including surgical drainage, or in more serious situations, duodenal diversion techniques
                        Biliary tree or duodenal perforation: management can range from NPO and AbX to stents/drains or surgery.
                        <br>
Gas insufflation of duodenum can cause post-op discomfort.
 <br> 
</p>
        
        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p> Prophylactic AbX. Pt may be NPO for extended period of time depending on complications.
            N/V managed with antiemetic IV. </p>
        
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p> Wound care, strict I&O monitoring, manage IVF, Skin care, percutaneous drain care (if applicable), foley care (if applicable), pain control, early ambulation. </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p> POD#1: OOB, advance diet as tolerated unless NPO, restart home Rx as able. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p>  Humidified 02, oral suction, standard IV-pump, possible PCA, and, SCDs. </p>

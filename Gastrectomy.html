        <h3> Procedure: </h3>
    <a href="mySicuPdf/Gastrectomy.pdf"> Gastrectomy (total & partial)</a>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p> CA & ulcers </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p>  Procedure can be performed laparoscopically or open. Access to stomach is obtained, stomach is dissected from surrounding tissues and anastomosis is created between esophagus and duodenum or jejunum. A partial gastrectomy involves dissecting a portion of the stomach and using the remaining tissue to preserve intestinal continuity. With a total, most often a J-tube is placed. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> Anastomic leak: swallow study can confirm a leak. CT scan can visualize extraluminal collections; these must be drained. Give systemic AbX for suspected leak. Usually ruled out by day 5-7. Small leaks can be managed with AbX, gastric decompression (NG/OG tube passed below anastomosis), and fluid drainage.
        <br>
Postgastrectomy syndromes: dumping syndrome, weight loss, and diarrhea; usually improve after 12 months, require symptomatic treatment: supplements, antidiarrheal,  and diet modification( avoid simple carbs).
<br>
Anastomic stricture: Usually presents as dysphagia, may require upper GI endoscopy with dilation.

        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p> IV Abx prophylaxis. All meds will be IV for first few days unless an OG/NG tube is approved for med use by surgeon. SubQ heparin. May require long-term electrolyte replacement due to decreased absorption. May require high calorie/high protein supplements. </p>
        <h4> Principles:</h4>
        <p> Temporary ileus is an expected physiologic response from bowel manipulation. If NG/OB tube is in place, do not manipulate or replace if dislodged (can disrupt anastomosis). Decreased absorption leads to weight loss, dumping syndrome, and electrolyte imbalances. </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p> Aggressive pulmonary toileting, skin care, wound care, foley care, pain control. Possible PCA, epidural,
And J-tube care. Manage IVF. NPO until barium swallow study (may allow sips and chips). Possible NG/OG tube care. </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p> POD #1 Early ambulation, NPO until POD# 2 or 3 after swallow study. Foley out after ambulating and diuresis (if no epidural). Early J-tube feedings may be initiated. After swallow study advance to CL, then soft solids. Restart home Rx as able. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p>  Humidified 02, oral suction, standard IV-pump, possible PCA, possible epidural, SCDs, and possible suction for NG/OG tube. </p>

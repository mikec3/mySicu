        <h3> Procedure: </h3>
        <p> Esophagectomy </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p> CA </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p> Thoracic approach involves a thoracotomy and removal of esophagus and surrounding lymph nobes. General surgery performs from a transhiatal approach and creates a mid-abdominal incision and a cervical (neck) incision. The esophagus and surrounding lymph nodes are removed. Either approach uses what is left, either stomach or intestine, to create a tube and attach to the cervical esophagus to retain gastric continuity.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> Pain: Epidural may be in place. IV opioids and opioid adjuncts will be used, no PO meds for 5-7 days.
            <br>
Pulm: ARDS can develop due to inflammation and reduction of lymph clearance in thoracic cavity. The patient may have a chest tube. Aggressive pulmonary toileting is required due to frequency of pulmonary complications.
            <br>
Hemo: Large fluid shifts can cause hypotension and edema.
Anastomosis leak: swallow study can confirm a leak. CT scan can visualize extraluminal collections; these must be drained. Give systemic AbX for suspected leak. Usually ruled out by day 5-7.
            <br>
A-fib: can occur in 20% of cases.
            <br>
Conduit ischemia: Can present as a rapid deterioration with s/s of septic shock. May need gastrostomy.
            <br>
Laryngeal nerve injury: May present as hoarseness, aspiration pneumonia, and/or dyspnea. Consult OTO.
            <br>
Chylothorax: Chyle leak into thoracic cavity from thoracic duct. Can be seen as fats in chest tube output. May require surgical intervention.

        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p>  NPO, nothing per NGT. </p>
      <br>
        <h4> Principles:</h4>
        <p> Decreased lymph clearance from thoracic cavity can cause pulmonary edema with too much IVF, however, hemodynamic instability may warrant fluid boluses. MIV most likely at a rate of 100-200 overnight, UOP 30ml/hr is accurate indicator of sufficient fluid resuscitation. NG tube will be in place, no manipulation or replacement of tube if it becomes dislodged; tube passes through the esophageal anastomosis. NPO for 5-7 days until anastomotic leak is R/O. May have J-tube for enteral feeding as well. If unable to resume enteral feedings, TPN may be started. </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p> Aggressive pulmonary toileting, hemodynamic monitoring and support, pain control, frequent turning, wound care, foley hygiene, NPO, manage IVF, donâ€™t manipulate NGT or replace if dislodged. Chest tube, A-line, J-tube, and epidural care if applicable. </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p> May come to SICU extubated or intubated. NPO 5-7 days. OOB as soon as able. NGT stays in place with no manipulation for 5-7 days. Foley stays in until mobilizing. Restart home Rx as soon as able. Stay in SICU until stable.

        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p> Possible vent setup. Possible for A-line, epidural, chest tube, and J-tube. Have Extra IV pumps available. Suction for oral, NGT, and chest tube. SCDs. Possible PCA. </p>

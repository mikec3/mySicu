  <div class="SCIS" id="BowelResection">
        <h3> Procedure: </h3>
        <p> Bowel resection (colostomy, colectomy, ex-lap, ileostomy, nissun-fundoplication). </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Indication: </h3>
        <p> CA, toxic mega-colon, obstruction, trauma </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
              <p> Abdominal cavity is accessed either open or laparoscopically. Bowel is manipulated and removed as necessary, diversions are made (colostomy, ileostomy) if necessary, and abdomen is closed.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Post-op Implications: </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Complications: </h4>
        <p> bleeding, surgical site infection, peritonitis, ileus, mechanical bowel obstruction, uncontrolled pain, peri-stomal skin breakdown.
 <br> 
</p>
        <br>
        <h4> Meds:</h4>
        <p>  If colostomy/ileostomy is performed, donâ€™t give extended release or long acting Rx.
   BM: supp/enema POD3 if no BM.
Pain: PCA and epidural Or PCEA (bipiv/fentanyl) are most common. </p>
        <h4> Principles:</h4>
        <p>  Temporary ileus is an expected physiologic response from bowel manipulation. At risk for acute dehydration due to
lack of h20 absorption in colon. Replace fluid lost through NG/OG with IVF to achieve normovolumea. Altered absorption can affect electrolytes. </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Care Plan:</h4>
        <p> Aggressive and frequent pulmonary hygiene. Ambulate and OOB POD#1. Skin care, wound care, foley hygiene, stoma
            care (if applicable) and pain control. Keep spare ostomy appliances at bedside. </p>
        <h4> Course of Care:</h4>
        <p>  POD# 1: OOB, clear liquid diet, foley out after ambulating, and NG/OG tube out after tolerating PO (if applicable).
            Educate pt on ostomy care. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Room Setup:</h3>
        <p> Humidified 02, oral suction, standard IV-pump, possible PCA, possible epidural, SCDs, and possible suction for NG/OG tube. </p>
